    "### Sentiment Analysis of the 2015 Refugee Crisis \n",
    "- Sentiment analysis of German newspapers around the 2015 refugee crisis. Did public opinion/the reporting shift towards refugees before, during, and after? Was the portrayal of refugees mostly postive of negative and what about sentiments towards the government? What about between newspapers on different ends of the political spectrum - was there a significant difference between their sentiments? "

    "#### The Data\n",
    "The data would be scraped from several well known German newspapers across the political spectrum, some examples would be: Der SÃ¼ddeustche Zeitung, https://www.sueddeutsche.de; Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, https://www.faz.net/aktuell/; Der Tagesspiegel, https://www.tagesspiegel.de. After being scraped and cleaned the data would need to be categorized by sentiment and a CSV (or several) built with such things as date of  publication, general political leaning of the newspaper, sentiment, article type, etc. The exact months/time span I am not sure of at this time. Ideally the size of the data set would strike a balence between usability and representativeness, perhaps several thousand articles? \n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "The end goal would be to figure out if and how sentiments towards refugees and migrants changed during the refugee crisis in 2015. The governments decision to let so many refugees in was very controversial and Germany ended up very polarized, resulting in a lot of government backlash and the rise of the AfD (\"Germany for the Germans\" kind of party) and alt-right there. Categorizing the articles into negative and positive is one part, but it would also be interesting to potentially analyse more specifics such as what words do they use for refugees and the mood/modality used (there are some fun \"tenses\" in German specifically for relaying things you don't agree with). The exact method of sentiment analysis I am unsure of, more research into different tools and methods is needed.\n",
