### First progress report
Created GitHub repository and added files.
Began looking into programs and library to help me with my work - Scrapy, SpaCy, BERT, Gensim.

### 2/27/21
Several snags have been hit:
1- Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) explicitly forbids data mining of any kind. https://www.faz.net/allgemeine-nutzungsbedingungen-von-faz-net-und-seinen-teilbereichen-11228149.html
2- Others the documentation was hard to find so I am waiting to hear back from several emails I sent them (it is the weekend and they are in Europe so I definitely don't expect an answer in the next 2 days)
3- Der Zeit, which has an API, does not easily allow you to see/scrape the actual article text, so I emailed them as well hopefully there will be an easy solution, if not I will use the API to get the URL's and go from there.
4- Still waiting to hear from Junge Freiheit because I could not find anything in the terms of use.

### 2/28/21
Managed to retrieve 100 relevant articles from Der Zeit, lots of work to be done on them and I need a lot more but I should wait to find out about copywrite, hoping to hear tomorrow.
